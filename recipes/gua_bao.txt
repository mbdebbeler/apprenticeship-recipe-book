How to Make
Making of Dough
1. Mix sugar, dry yeast and water together and stir until sugar and dry yeast dissolve in water.
2. Put all purpose flour and salt in a mixing bowl and slowly add the water(with sugar and yeast inside) into the bowl.
3. Mix the ingredients into a dough, until not sticky, then add oil into the dough. Kneed the dough until it absorb all the oil in the bowl.

Resting of Dough
1. Put the dough in oven with a glass of water by its side for 60-90 mins. It will become about 1.5 times bigger and stay with a deep dimple when you poke.
2. Take out the dough and use a roller to make an oval shape. Brush some cooking oil on the upper side and fold in half.
3. Let it rest in a warm/humid place for 20-30 mins.

Preparation of the Stuffing
1. Pan fried the pork belly until caramelized on the outside. Put the spices into a tea bag and then add all the ingredients into a pot. Stew for 1 hour.
2. Cut the mustard greens into strings and then stir-fried with a stick of chili and a glove of garlic for about 5 mins. Set aside and let it cool.
3. Mix sugar and ground peanuts together, adjust the sweetness by personal preference. Cut coriander roughly (about 1.5cm long)

Steaming
1. Steam the dough for from cold water. Cook for 12 mins after the water is boiling. Open the lid for a little space to avoid the water dropping on the top of the dough.
2. Put all the stuffing into the steam bun and you are good to go!
