Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies

Flour - 17 oz (Original recipe has half cake flour and half bread flour.  I use all-purpose flour.)
Baking soda - 1 1/4 tsp
Baking powder - 1 1/2 tsp
Coarse salt - 1 1/2 tsp
Unsalted butter - 1 1/14 cups
Light brown sugar - 1 1/4 cups or 10 oz
Granulated sugar - 1 cup + 2 tblsp or 8 oz
Large eggs - 2
Natural vanilla extract - 2 tsp
Chocolate - 1 1/14 lbs or 20 oz (Recipe wants “bittersweet chocolate disks” with at least 60% cacao.  I use normal semi-sweet chocolate chips.)

Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and set aside.
Cream butter and sugars until light (they suggest a standing mixer).
Add eggs one at a time, and mix well.
Stir in vanilla.
Add dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
Add chocolate chips or pieces.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate and rest for at least 24 hours.  (Up to 48 hours.  No particular length of time seems to work better.)
Make cookies of 3 ½ ounces, the size of generous golf balls.  Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake at 350 degrees for 18 – 20 minutes (actually, 16:30 in my oven).   In my experience, the original recipe makes 22 – 24 cookies.
