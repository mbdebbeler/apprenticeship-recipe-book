Title:
Ice Cubes

Ingredients:
2 cups water (approximately)
2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)

Directions:
- Empty any ice cubes that are left in the trays into the bin.
- Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with water. (Tip: hot water will freeze faster and the cubes will be more clear.)
- Place the water-filled ice trays back in the freezer.
- Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.
- Shut the door to the freezer.
- Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.
