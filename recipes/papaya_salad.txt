Lightly pound and mix ingredients for that Thai spicy or not GreenPapaya salad spiced to your preference.

Instructions
Put chili, garlic and yard long beans in mortar and pound lightly with the pistol (breaking the outer skin of all ingredients)
Add sugar, fish sauce and lime juice, mix.
Add cherry tomato, peanuts, mix. Last you add the green papaya and mix.
For som tum phoo (crab), omit the toasted peanuts and add salted crabs instead. Microwave the salted crabs for 30 seconds before adding them to the papaya salad to kill any residual bacteria. Add only half of the fish sauce called for because the salted crab can be quite salty.
