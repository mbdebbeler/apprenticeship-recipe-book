CLASSIC PASTA DOUGH
1kg “00” Flour
10 Fresh Large Eggs
METHOD

Take the flour and make a hole in the middle
of it with your hands. Open the eggs and put
them in the hole with a pinch. Start to mix the
eggs with a fork and incorporate slowly the
flour. When it begins to be more compact
start to work with your hands. Work the pasta
for about 10 minutes or as soon it looks nice
and smooth. Leave the pasta(wrapped in film)
rest in the fridge for 15 min.
